Welcome to the Town of Summerside!
================================

Jay Wallace, Shaun McIntyre, Glen Richardson and Clayton Moore are all childhood friends. After a decade, they all decided to have a little reunion. The following day, Jay is found dead on the beach!

As the new detective in town, it's your job to solve the mystery. 
Using the previous detective's notes, piece together the story by investigating the evidence
board and clicking on the clues to view them.

Tips
---------------------------------
1. Pay careful attention to each clue.
2. Try to figure out a motive and a timeline.
3. Have fun!

Gameplay
--------------------------------
There are three clues in total: a map, a picture, and a letter. When youâ€™re ready, pick the 
person you think committed the crime! But be careful, as you only have 2 attempts to get it right.  

Starting at the introduction page, navigate through the game by clicking on the different clues. 

To exit each clue, click the "Done" button. To make a guess, another window will appear with the three suspect names. Click on the name you believe is the murderer. 

The number of attempts will be displayed on the screen.

Additionally, there may be a delay with clicking buttons on certain devices.

	1. SDL2 library:
